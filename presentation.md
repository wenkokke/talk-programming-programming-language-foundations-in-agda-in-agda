# Programming Programming <br /> Language Foundations <br /> in Agda in Agda

## by Wen Kokke

You: "What's an 'Agda'?"

Me: "It's a proof assistant!"

You: "What's a proof assistant?"

Me: "Uh..."

^
So, uh, before we dive in, I should perhaps set the stage.

^
A proof assistant is a bunch of software to help you with writing formal, machine-checked proofs.

^
And sure, Agda is that, but Agda is also a dependently-typed programming language. 

^
Turns out if you go deep enough, the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs kinda... breaks down the distinction.

^
There will be two main players in this story.

## ACL2, Agda, **Agda 2**, Albatross, ALF, Aquarius, ATS, Automath, <br /> a blackboard, Blodwen, Cambridge LCF, Cayenne, **Cedille**, Clam, Clam 2, Clam 3, CLIN, **Coq**, Dafny, Dependent ML, DISCOUNT, Epigram, EQP, ETPS, F\*, **Haskell**, HOL Light, **HOL4**, HOL88, HOL90, **Idris**, IMPS, InKa, Intercal, Isabelle, Jape, KeY, LambdaClam, LCF77, **Lean**, LEGO, Logic Theorist, Mace, **Mace4**, Matita, Metamath, me, MINLOG, Mizar, MKRP, NQTHM, NuPRL, OLEG, OMEGA, OSHL, **Otter**, Peers, Peers-mcd.a, Peers-mcd.b, Peers-mcd.c, Peers-mcd.d, PhoX, PLTP, PRESS, ProCom, **Prover9**, PRV, PVS, RDL, scunac, SETHEO, SNARK, TPS, Twelf, Typelab, Yarrow


^
THESE are proof assistants.

^
I've highlighted those that I've worked with personally.

^
If you don't think Haskell is a proof assistant, tell that to the proof of cut elimination for Lambek-calculus that I wrote in Haskell.

^
Anyway, these run the gamut from "checks if a theorem is provable in first-order logic" to "checks if your imperative program is doing something stupid" to "maybe we can do all of math here?"

^
There's a specific kind of proof assistant that I care about: dependently-typed programming languages. They live in the last category, usually.

Agda doesn't conventionally have a logo, but I think I've solved that problem... 

^
Btw, this is a slightly tweaked version of Ulf's logo design.

And I'm pretty sure this means it's the official logo now.

No matter how much certain supervisors of mine would like it to be different.

^
Btw, this future T-shirt was brought to you by Aive Kalmus.

I have changed the colour scheme a wee bit.

# A Brief History of Wen
## (the relevant bits)

---

# (2014) <br /> I was taught Coq and Agda in the same course, <br /> one after the other, <br /> by this guy.

![right fit](wouter.png)

^
Was able to work with both languages.

^
Formalised Jeremy Gibbons' Enumerating the Rationals in Coq.

^
Didn't understand what Gallina code was generated when running Ltac.

^
Wasn't until I learned Agda that Coq started to make sense.

# (2016) <br /> Taught Software foundations, <br /> with this guy. <br /><br /> He did most of the lecturing, tbh.

^
In my first year, I taught from Software Foundations with Phil.

^
He did most of the lecturing, tbh, in part because lecturing students was FAR above my pay grade.

^
The plan for PLFA was hatched.

^
We hoped to teach the students Agda in the following year.

^
So we wrote some initial chapters.

# (2017) <br /> Taught Software foundations, <br /> with this guy. <br /><br /> I gave several additional lectures on Agda!

^
We failed, of course. 

^
I was ready to give it a shot, but Phil had all these concerns about "keeping up the quality of the course" and "not going into a course with more than half of the lecture notes unwritten."

^
I DID teach the students some Agda, mostly based on Conor's lecture notes of the previous year. The students had already finished Software Foundations at this point, which was interesting.

^
Plus, I got to finally use comedy.el!

That's what REAL slides look like.

# My Troubles with Coq...

# ...disappear with Agda!

<!--!>

coq vs. agda in teaching:

* gallina & ltac vs. agda
* tactics obscure understanding
* notation is... less readable (+unicode rant)

progress + preservation = evaluation:

* progress proof is an *evaluation strategy*

spoilers:

* system f
* abstract machines
* linear type systems using quantitative type theory
* session typed systems using quantitative type theory
* denotational semantics of the untyped lambda calculus
* please let us know if you'd like to contribute!
